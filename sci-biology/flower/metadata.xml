		flower - FLOWgram ExtractoR tools
		
		The flower executable reads files in SFF-format and produces various output,
		including sequences with quality, or flowgram data in tabular format.  By default,
		it outputs a textual representation of the data in the SFF-file, much like
		&#39;sffinfo&#39; from Roche does.
		
		The fselect executable extracts reads from SFF-files, generating a new
		SFF-file with a subset of the reads based on various criteria.
		
		Sometimes SFF files will appear to be corrupted, with all-zero blocks in the
		file. The frecover program ignores these and tries to resync with the file after an
		invalid region.  This was likely a one-time bug in the 454 software, so this program
		is probably not so useful any more.
