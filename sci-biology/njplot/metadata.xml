		NJplot is a tree drawing program able to draw any phylogenetic tree
		expressed in the Newick phylogenetic tree format (e.g., the format used
		by the PHYLIP package). NJplot is especially convenient for rooting the
		unrooted trees obtained from parsimony, distance or maximum likelihood
		tree-building methods.
