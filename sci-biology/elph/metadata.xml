		ELPH is a general-purpose Gibbs sampler for finding motifs in a set of
		DNA or protein sequences. The program takes as input a set containing
		anywhere from a few dozen to thousands of sequences, and searches
		through them for the most common motif, assuming that each sequence
		contains one copy of the motif.
