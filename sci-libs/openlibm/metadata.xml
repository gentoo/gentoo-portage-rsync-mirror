  OpenLibm is an effort to have a high quality standalone LIBM
  library. It is meant to be used standalone in applications and
  programming language implementations.
  OpenLibm also includes the AMOS library from Netlib, which is a
  portable package for Bessel Functions of a Complex Argument and
  Nonnegative Order. AMOS contains subroutines for computing Bessel
  functions and Airy functions.
  The OpenLIBM code derives from the FreeBSD msun implementation, which
  in turn derives from FDLIBM 5.3. As a result, it has a number of fixes
  and updates that have accumulated over the years in msun, and also
  optimized assembly versions of many functions.
