  The COIN-OR Formulation of Linear Optimization Problems in C++
  (FLOPC++) is a linear optimization modelling language that can be
  specified in a declarative style, similar to algebraic modelling
  languages such as GAMS and AMPL, within a C++ program. As a result
  the traditional strengths of algebraic modelling languages are
  preserved, while embedding linear optimization models in software
  applications is facilitated.
