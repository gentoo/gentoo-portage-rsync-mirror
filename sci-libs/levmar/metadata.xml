<longdescription lang="en">
  levmar is a native ANSI C implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt
  optimization algorithm.  Both unconstrained and constrained (under
  linear equations, inequality and box constraints)
  Levenberg-Marquardt variants are included. The LM algorithm is an
  iterative technique that finds a local minimum of a function that is
  expressed as the sum of squares of nonlinear functions.
