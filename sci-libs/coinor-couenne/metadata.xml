  Couenne (Convex Over and Under ENvelopes for Nonlinear Estimation)
  is a spatial branch and bound algorithm that implements linearization, bound
  reduction, and branching techniques for Mixed-integer, Nonlinear
  Programming (MINLP) problems. The purpose of Couenne is to find global
  optima of nonconvex MINLPs.
