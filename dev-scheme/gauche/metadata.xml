    Gauche is an R5RS Scheme implementation developed to be a handy script
    interpreter, which allows programmers and system administrators to write
    small to large scripts for their daily chores. Quick startup, built-in
    system interface, native multilingual support are some of my goals.

    Gauche runs on several Unix-like platforms.
