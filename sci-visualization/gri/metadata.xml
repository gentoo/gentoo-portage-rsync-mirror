  Gri is a language for scientific graphics programming. The word
  "language" is important: Gri is command-driven, not
  point/click. Some users liken Gri to LaTeX, since both provide
  extensive power in exchange for patience in learning syntax. Gri can
  make x-y graphs, contour graphs, and image graphs, in PostScript and
  (someday) SVG formats. Control is provided over all aspects of
  drawing, e.g. line widths, colors, and fonts. A TeX-like syntax
  provides common mathematical symbols.
