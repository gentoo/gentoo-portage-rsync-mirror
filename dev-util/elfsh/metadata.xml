ELFsh is an interactive and scriptable ELF machine to play with executable files, shared libraries and relocatable ELF32 objects. It is useful for daily binary manipulations such as on-the-fly patching, embedded code injection, and binary analysis in research fields such as reverse engineering, security auditing and intrusion detection.
