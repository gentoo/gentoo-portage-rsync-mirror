# Following variables controls the minimal and maximum amounts of memory
# allocated to the permanent generation space.
# This space contains data related to all classes.
# Thus, if you use a lot of Eclipse plugins, it is recommended to uncomment
# these variables and even increase it, if you have enough RAM.
# Else you will get crashes related to OutOfMemory in PermGen exceptions.
