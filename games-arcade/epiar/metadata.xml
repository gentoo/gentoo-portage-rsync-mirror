Epiar is a space adventure/combat game written in C with SDL 
(Simple DirectMedia Layer). It is absolutely free (released 
under the General Public License v2).
In Epiar, you begin as a shuttle pilot in a galaxy generally 
ruled by anarchy, with few stable governments and numerous 
rebel factions. You start your adventure off doing whatever 
you want, but generally trying to save up money for a new 
starship, and your adventure takes off from there ...
