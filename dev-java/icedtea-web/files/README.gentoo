Manage Plugin
-------------
The IcedTea browser plugin (NPPlugin) can be enabled using
eselect java-nsplugin.

Select JVM
----------
IcedTea-Web (>=1.4) supports selecting the JVM to use for the plugin. Currently
works for all IcedTea releases. The eselect module java-nsplugin in
>=eselect-java-0.1.0 added support for this.

Per user configuration
----------------------
IcedTea-Web also supports per user configuration which takes precedence over the
global choice of JVM managed by the java-nsplugin module. If you made use of
itweb-settings as user to set a JVM for instance and want to give control back
to java-nsplugin to manage the JVM to use run as your user:
'sed -i -e "/^deployment.jre.dir=/d" ~/.icedtea/deployment.properties'

Per user plugin selection via eselect java-nsplugin is a longstanding feature
request. Bug 148632
