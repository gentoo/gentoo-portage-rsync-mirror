 This is the main Reference implementation of the BCEL JavaClass API.
 The Byte Code Engineering Library (formerly known as JavaClass) is intended 
 to give users a convenient possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate 
 (binary) Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes are represented 
 by objects which contain all the symbolic information of the given class: 
 methods, fields and byte code instructions, in particular.
