Mckoi SQL Database is an SQL (Structured Query Language) Database
management system written for the JavaTM platform. Mckoi SQL Database is
optimized to run as a client/server database server for multiple
clients, however it can also be embedded in an application as a
stand-alone database. It is highly multi-threaded and features an
extendable object-oriented engine.
    
Mckoi SQL Database started as an internal project and has since evolved
from its inception in 1998. The main goals of the project are a code
base that is simple to maintain and extend, ease of use and
administration, robustness, multiple concurrent access, and performance.
