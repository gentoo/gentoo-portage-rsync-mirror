MG4J (Managing Gigabytes for Java) is a collaborative effort aimed at providing
a free Java implementation of inverted-index compression techniques; as a
by-product, it offers several general-purpose optimised classes, including fast
&amp; compact mutable strings, bit-level I/O, fast unsychronised buffered
streams, (possibly signed) minimal perfect hashing for very large strings
collections, etc.
