Mock Objects is a test-first development process for building
object-oriented software and a generic unit testing framework that
supports that process. Mock objects give you:

* A methodology for developing and using mock objects. 

* A core mock objects framework. This is a library of code that supports
  the implementation of mock objects. It is based around a set of
  expectation classes for values and collections. There are also various
  other classes to make mock objects easier to write or to use.

* A default set of mock implementations for the standard Java platform
  APIs. We have made a start on packages such as servlets, sql, and io.

* Mock implementations for more specialised libraries, particularly
  third party products. So far, we have started on ATG Dynamo and IBM's
  VisualAge for Java tools API.

* A community for exchanging ideas on anything related to unit testing,
  with a bias towards Mock Objects. 

Our larger aim is to make www.mockobjects.com the point of reference for
ideas and tools for unit testing particularly based on Mock Objects. Our
first implementation is in Java, largely because that's what we've been
working in, but also because it has a stable set of APIs that are
suitable for writing Mock Objects. We have applied these techniques to
other environments and intend to publish the results here.
