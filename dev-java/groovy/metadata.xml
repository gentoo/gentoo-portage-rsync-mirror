Groovy is a new agile dynamic language for the JVM combining lots of great
features from languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk and making them
available to the Java developers using a Java-like syntax.

Groovy is designed to help you get things done on the Java platform in a
quicker, more concise and fun way - bringing the power of Python and Ruby inside
the Java platform.

Groovy can be used as an alternative compiler to javac to generate standard Java
bytecode to be used by any Java project or it can be used dynamically as an
alternative language such as for scripting Java objects, templating or writing
unit test cases.
