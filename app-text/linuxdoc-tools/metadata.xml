    Linuxdoc-Tools is a small bug-fix version of SGML-Tools 1.0.9, and
    is a toolset for processing LinuxDoc DTD SGML files.  This system
    is tailored for LinuxDoc DTD sgml files, and other DTDs are not
    supported.  If you need the tool for DocBook DTD (which is now a
    more popular DTD than LinuxDoc in writing technical software
    documentation), then you should check other packages such as
    SGMLTools-Lite and OpenJade.
