After a long period on "life support", the catalyst repository is
going to have major changes introduced to master in the next few days.
The work done in the rewrite branch[1] by Brian Dolbec, is finally
going to be merged into master through the pending branch[2].
Anyone using catalyst to produce stages is advised to use the latest
release (currently 2.0.16). If you need to track the stable 2.X branch,
please use the catalyst 2.0.9999 ebuild.
Anyone wanting to help with catalyst development and testing is
encouraged to use the 9999 version and report issues to the catalyst
team, pending the understanding that master may be broken during the
next few months. Please report any issues to our bugzilla[3]. You
can always find us in the #gentoo-releng irc channel of freenode.
To be clear, these changes will only affect catalyst-9999 and the
master branch of the repository. If you're not using either, this
doesn't affect you.
