Beginning with sys-apps/portage-2.1.12, FEATURES=preserve-libs is
enabled by default. Even though preserve-libs makes it unnecessary to
use revdep-rebuild for most common updates, it is still a good practice
to run `revdep-rebuild -ip` after updates, in order to check if there
are any broken library dependencies that preserve-libs was not able to
handle. For example, see http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=459038.

If you would like to disable preserve-libs by default, then set
FEATURES="-preserve-libs" in make.conf. See the make.conf(5) man page
or the following wiki page for more information:
