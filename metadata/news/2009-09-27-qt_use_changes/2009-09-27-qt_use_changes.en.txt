Qt version 4.5.2 has significant changes in the USE flags enabled by
default.

When upgrading, make sure you check and re-enable any USE flags you
need.

Depending on your system and installed packages, you might hit an issue
where Portage is getting confused by this USE flag change, trying to mix
old 4.5.1 ebuilds with new 4.5.2 ones, resulting in blocks.

If this happens to you, please add the offending USE flags (usually
'qt3support' and 'dbus') in your USE= or switch to a desktop profile
(eselect profile list). Check this post [0] for more details on this
issue.
