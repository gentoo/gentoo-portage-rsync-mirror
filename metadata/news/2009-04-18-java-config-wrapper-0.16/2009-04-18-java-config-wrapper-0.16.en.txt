For a long time the Java team required a 1.4 JDK to be
installed in order for old java ebuilds to work. All these
ebuilds are now gone from the main tree so the requirement
to have a 1.4 JDK installed has been lifted.

In order to remove things left over by the generation 1
setup please run java-check-environment and follow the
instructions.

If you want to remove 1.4 JDKs, you should use emerge --depclean.
Depending on what you have installed you might not need a
1.4 JDK any more. To see if you still need a 1.4 JDK use:

emerge -av --depclean virtual/jdk:1.4

If you don't need virtual/jdk:1.4 any more then you can remove the
individual JDKs. First get the list of installed JDKs with
eselect and then remove those that are not needed any longer with
depclean, for example:

eselect java-vm list
emerge -av --depclean sun-jdk:1.4
