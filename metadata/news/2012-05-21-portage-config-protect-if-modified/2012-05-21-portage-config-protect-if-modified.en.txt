Beginning with sys-apps/portage-2.1.10.61, FEATURES=config-protect-if-modified
is enabled by default. This causes the CONFIG_PROTECT behavior to be skipped
for files that have not been modified since they were installed.

If you would like to disable this behavior by default, then set
FEATURES="-config-protect-if-modified" in make.conf. See the make.conf(5) man
page for more information about this feature.
