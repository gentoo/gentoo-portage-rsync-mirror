Toy Cars is a physics based 2-D racer. In Timed Race mode the aim is to complete
four laps in the best time you can. In Hot Potato mode the aim is to avoid
having the bomb when the fuse runs out. The bomb can be transfered between
players if they crash into each other. In Knock 'em Out mode the aim is to
race around the track and to try and prevent your car from going off the screen.
