Past Gentoo rsync-to-git mirror
===============================

This repository used to contain the Gentoo rsync tree packed into git
repository. However, on 2015-08-09 Gentoo officially switched to git,
making this effort unnecessary.

New resources:

1. [cgit for offical repo](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git),
2. [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo),
3. [GitHub mirror with pre-generated metadata
   cache](https://github.com/gentoo-mirrors/gentoo).

For development, please use either 1. or 2. You can submit Pull Requests
either via mail (`git request-pull`) or using GitHub mirror.

For user syncing, 3. is preferable. However, please do not submit Pull
Requests there. Also note that signatures are not mirrored there at
the moment.
