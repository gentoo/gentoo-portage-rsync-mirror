.SH NAME
i2pd \- Load-balanced unspoofable packet switching network

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B i2pd
[\fIOPTION1\fR) [\fIOPTION2\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
i2pd
is a C++ implementation of the router for the I2P anonymizing network, offering
a simple layer that identity-sensitive applications can use to securely
communicate. All data is wrapped with several layers of encryption, and the
network is both distributed and dynamic, with no trusted parties.
