# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and
# an explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely
# careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale
# breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
# d) the word "removal"
#
## Example:
##
## Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (25 Jan 2013)
## Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## funny. (bug #987654)

# For most use cases you can unmask this and use this
# as there has been ample interested. This however breaks
# a number of features fundamental to me.
# * migration from previous versions is broken and migration
#   to future versions is broken
# * snapshoting (blockcommit) is not safe/stable as it will
#   report success when the write has not completed
# Upstream considers this series EOL and recommends 1.4
# which at the time of this writing is unreleased. So
# this is in the tree for people that want/need it but its masked.
