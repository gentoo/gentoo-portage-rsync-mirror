# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and
# an explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely
# careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale
# breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (25 Jan 2013)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

#--- END OF EXAMPLES ---

# Tom Wijsman <TomWij@gentoo.org> (28 Aug 2013)
# on behalf of Luca Barbato <lu_zero@gentoo.org>
# masked new eselect, because the bashcomp module
# suddenly disappeared which doesn't cause a wonderful
# experience for our users especially with the lack
# of news or documentation explaining the change;
# also masked new bash-completion, because it
# breaks starting bash for some users, has broken
# bash completions (eg. git) and some people
# manually need to source bash completions after
# a lot of confusion what is really going on.
#
# These packages need one or more of: a news
# article explaining what is going on and what
# the new way of using bash completions is, bug
# fixes such that a large share just works and
# consider to bring back lost the lost eselect.
