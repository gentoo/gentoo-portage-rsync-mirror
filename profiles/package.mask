# When you add an entry to the top of this file, add your name, the date, and
# an explanation of why something is getting masked. Please be extremely
# careful not to commit atoms that are not valid, as it can cause large-scale
# breakage, especially if it ends up in the daily snapshot.
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (28 Jun 2012)
## # Masking  these versions until we can get the
## # v4l stuff to work properly again
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5
## =media-video/mplayer-0.90_pre5-r1
#
# - Best last rites (removal) practices -
# Include the following info:
# a) reason for masking
# b) bug # for the removal (and yes you should have one)
# c) date of removal (either the date or "in x days")
#
## Example:
##
## # Dev E. Loper <developer@gentoo.org> (25 Jan 2013)
## # Masked for removal in 30 days.  Doesn't work
## # with new libfoo. Upstream dead, gtk-1, smells
## # funny. (bug #987654)

# =sys-kernel/gentoo-sources-3.8.13 is masked due to multiple security bugs:
#
# 1. Security Bug #475618: CVE-2013-1059:
# Linux Kernel: Ceph: NULL Pointer Dereference Denial of Service Vulnerability
#
# 2. Security Bug #480200: CVE-2013-4205:
# Linux Kernel: CLONE_NEWUSER local DoS
#
# 3. Security Bug #482896: From CVE-2013-2888 to CVE-2013-2899:
# Linux Kernel: HID security flaws (Memory writes and leaks, NULL DoS, etc...)
#
# This kernel also contains other security bugs due to its old age (May 11).
#
# We advice users to upgrade to the new stable kernel 3.10.7; alternatively, if
# necessary, users can also choose to accept keywords and accept a kernel from
# the earlier long term stable branches (3.0.X or 3.4.Y), this might be the case
# if you have older hardware or an unfortunate stability bug on 3.10.7.
#
# You can accept keywords by adding sys-kernel/gentoo-sources to the file
# /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords after which you can run
# `emerge sys-kernel/gentoo-sources:X.Y.Z` to select a specific LTS kernel.
# When you choose to turn back to stable later, don't forget to remove that.
#
# For proprietary NVIDIA drivers users, we temporarily keep 3.9.11-r1 around
# as some of them experience problems with the new stable kernel 3.10.7; we aim
# to mask it in one of the next weeks when the time is right.
