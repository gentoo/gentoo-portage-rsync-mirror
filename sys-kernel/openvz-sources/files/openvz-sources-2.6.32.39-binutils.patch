Subject: x86, binutils, xen: Fix another wrong size directive
X-Git-Tag: v2.6.39-rc1~506^2
X-Git-Url: http://git.itanic.dy.fi/?p=linux-stable;a=commitdiff_plain;h=371c394af27ab7d1e58a66bc19d9f1f3ac1f67b4

x86, binutils, xen: Fix another wrong size directive

The latest binutils (2.21.0.20110302/Ubuntu) breaks the build
yet another time, under CONFIG_XEN=y due to a .size directive that
refers to a slightly differently named (hence, to the now very
strict and unforgiving assembler, non-existent) symbol.

[ mingo:

   This unnecessary build breakage caused by new binutils
   version 2.21 gets escallated back several kernel releases spanning
   several years of Linux history, affecting over 130,000 upstream
   kernel commits (!), on CONFIG_XEN=y 64-bit kernels (i.e. essentially
   affecting all major Linux distro kernel configs).

   Git annotate tells us that this slight debug symbol code mismatch
   bug has been introduced in 2008 in commit 3d75e1b8:

     3d75e1b8        (Jeremy Fitzhardinge    2008-07-08 15:06:49 -0700 1231) ENTRY(xen_do_hypervisor_callback)   # do_hypervisor_callback(struct *pt_regs)

   The 'bug' is just a slight assymetry in ENTRY()/END()
   debug-symbols sequences, with lots of assembly code between the
   ENTRY() and the END():

     ENTRY(xen_do_hypervisor_callback)   # do_hypervisor_callback(struct *pt_regs)
       ...
     END(do_hypervisor_callback)

   Human reviewers almost never catch such small mismatches, and binutils
   never even warned about it either.

   This new binutils version thus breaks the Xen build on all upstream kernels
   since v2.6.27, out of the blue.

   This makes a straightforward Git bisection of all 64-bit Xen-enabled kernels
   impossible on such binutils, for a bisection window of over hundred
   thousand historic commits. (!)

   This is a major fail on the side of binutils and binutils needs to turn
   this show-stopper build failure into a warning ASAP. ]
