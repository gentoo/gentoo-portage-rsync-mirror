# DEVELOPERS' NOTE!
#
# This virtual has multiple version that ties one-by-one with the Ruby
# implementation they provide the value for; this is to simplify
# keywording practise that has been shown to be very messy for other
# virtuals.
#
# Make sure that you DO NOT change the version of the virtual's
# ebuilds unless you're adding a new implementation; instead simply
# revision-bump it.
#
# A reference to ~${PV} for each of the version has to be added to
# profiles/base/package.use.force to make sure that they are always
# used with their own implementation.
#
# ruby_add_[br]depend will take care of depending on multiple versions
# without any frown.
