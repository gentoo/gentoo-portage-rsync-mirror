If you are UPGRADING from an earlier version, you can use the upgrade scripts
at admin/ to execute the pending database updates. For more information,
please, see http://manual.mantisbt.org/manual.installation.upgrading.php .

To INSTALL, visit: http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/admin/install.php
Then log in: Username - administrator, Password - root. You can load up
admin/check.php to CHECK if everything is working correctly.

Then edit ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/config_inc.php as necessary.

After you've finished these steps, please delete the admin/ directory.

Don't forget to read the online manual (http://manual.mantisbt.org/)!!!
