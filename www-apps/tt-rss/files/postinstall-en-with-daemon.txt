Once you have configured TT-RSS, put the path to this instance into
the INSTANCE_DIRS variable in /etc/conf.d/ttrssd. Make sure that
the ttrssd user can access the path, and then start the update daemon
with

  /etc/init.d/ttrssd start

to get your feeds updated. Add the daemon to your default runlevel,
so that it gets launched after a system restart:

  rc-update add ttrssd default


Note on update from 1.5.6 or earlier: The directory containing the
feed icons has been renamed from 'icons' to 'feed-icons'. Please
move your *.ico files over, and then remove the old 'icons' dir.
