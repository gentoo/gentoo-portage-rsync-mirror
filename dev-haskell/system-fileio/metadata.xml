		This is a small wrapper around the \&quot;directory\&quot;, \&quot;unix\&quot;, and \&quot;Win32\&quot;
		packages, for use with \&quot;system-filepath\&quot;. It provides a consistent API
		to the various versions of these packages distributed with different
		versions of GHC.
		
		In particular, this library supports working with POSIX files that have
		paths which can&#39;t be decoded in the current locale encoding.
