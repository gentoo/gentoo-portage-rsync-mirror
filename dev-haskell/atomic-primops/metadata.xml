		After GHC 7.4 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but it&#39;s
		difficult to use safely, because pointer equality is a highly
		unstable property in Haskell.  This library provides a safer method
		based on the concept of &quot;Tickets&quot;.
		
		Also, this library uses the &quot;foreign primop&quot; capability of GHC to
		add access to other variants that may be of
		interest, specifically, compare and swap inside an array.
