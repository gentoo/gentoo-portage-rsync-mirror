		The documentation of &quot;System.Environment.getProgName&quot; says that
		\&quot;However, this is hard-to-impossible to implement on some non-Unix OSes,
		so instead, for maximum portability, we just return the leafname
		of the program as invoked.\&quot;
		This library tries to provide the missing path.
