		This package provides functions to fork threads and
		wait for their result, whether it&#39;s an exception or a
		normal value.
		
		Besides waiting for the termination of a single thread
		this packages also provides functions to wait for a
		group of threads to terminate.
		
		This package is similar to the
		@threadmanager@, @async@ and @spawn@ packages.
		The advantages of this package are:
		
		* Simpler API.
		
		* More efficient in both space and time.
		
		* No space-leak when forking a large number of threads.
		
		* Correct handling of asynchronous exceptions.
		
		* GHC specific functionality like @forkOn@ and @forkIOWithUnmask@.
