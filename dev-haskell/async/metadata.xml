		This package provides a higher-level interface over
		threads, in which an @Async a@ is a concurrent
		thread that will eventually deliver a value of
		type @a@.  The package provides ways to create
		@Async@ computations, wait for their results, and
		cancel them.
		
		Using @Async@ is safer than using threads in two
		ways:
		
		* When waiting for a thread to return a result,
		if the thread dies with an exception then the
		caller must either re-throw the exception
		(&#39;wait&#39;) or handle it (&#39;waitCatch&#39;); the
		exception cannot be ignored.
		
		* The API makes it possible to build a tree of
		threads that are automatically killed when
		their parent dies (see &#39;withAsync&#39;).
		
		Changes in 2.0.1.3:
		
		* Bump @base@ dependency to allow 4.6
		
		Changes in 2.0.1.2:
		
		* Bump @stm@ dependency to 2.4
		
		Changes in 2.0.1.1:
		
		* Safe Haskell support: @Control.Concurrent.Async@ is now @Trustworthy@
		
		Changes in 2.0.1.0:
		
		* Added a @Functor@ instance for @Async@
		
		* Added @asyncBound@, @asyncOn@, @asyncWithUnmask@, @asyncOnWithUnmask@, @withAsyncBound@, @withAsyncOn@, @withAsyncWithUnmask@, @withAsyncOnWithUnmask@.
		
		* Added @mapConcurrently@
		
		* Added @Concurrently@ (with @Applicative@ and @Alternative@ instances)
