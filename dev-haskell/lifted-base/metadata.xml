		@lifted-base@ exports IO operations from the base library lifted to
		any instance of &#39;MonadBase&#39; or &#39;MonadBaseControl&#39;.
		
		Note that not all modules from @base@ are converted yet. If
		you need a lifted version of a function from @base@, just
		ask me to add it or send me a patch.
		
		The package includes a copy of the @monad-peel@ testsuite written
		by Anders Kaseorg The tests can be performed using @cabal test@.
