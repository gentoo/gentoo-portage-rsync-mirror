		This package provides methods for fully evaluating data structures
		("deep evaluation"). Deep evaluation is often used for adding
		strictness to a program, e.g. in order to force pending exceptions,
		remove space leaks, or force lazy I/O to happen. It is also useful
		in parallel programs, to ensure pending work does not migrate to the
		wrong thread.
