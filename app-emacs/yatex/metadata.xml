  YaTeX is an intelligent, acquisitive and integrated package which reduces
  your efforts of composing LaTeX source on Emacs. And yahtml is the honest
  and bright YaTeX-compatible major-mode package for writing HTML. If you have
  noticed the power of YaTeX, you can drive yahtml over the HTML files quickly
  and steadily. And vice versa, of course.
