  Imaxima provides support for interacting with the computer algebra system
  Maxima in an Emacs buffer. Imaxima processes the output from Maxima with TeX
  and inserts the resulting image in the buffer. The command imaxima provides
  a simple comint derived CLI mode. The command imaxima-latex prepares a LaTeX
  version of the Maxima buffer. Imaxima can also be hooked in to the Emacs
  mode included with Maxima, which provides more key bindings and other
  conveniences.
