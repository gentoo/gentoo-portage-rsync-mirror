Subject: server: don't assert on invalid client message

Some users have been reaching this error:
snd_receive: ASSERT n failed

A misbehaving client could easily hit that condition by sending too big
messages. Instead of assert(), replace with a warning. When a message
too big to fit is received, it will simply disconnect the channel.
