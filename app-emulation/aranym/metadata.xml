		ARAnyM is an acronym: Atari Running on Any Machine. It is a virtual
		machine software for running the Atari ST/TT/Falcon operating systems
		(TOS, FreeMiNT, MagiC and others) and TOS/GEM applications. In the
		combination of ARAnyM/Linux and AFROS you basically get a completely
		free TOS/MiNT compatible operating system running on any machine.
		That's a break-through for all Atari users - now you can turn almost
		any hardware into your familiar TOS/GEM system.
