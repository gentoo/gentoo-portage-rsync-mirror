Subject: [PATCH 4/6] Make spell checking work again. The text edit used the
 wrong config file for loading spell settings. After
 using the config file, the correct settigns get loaded
 again, since the Loader from Sonnet is a singleton and
 therefore shares the settings, so even the textedit
 with the wrong settings file name gets updated.

cherry-picked from d1708effbb68d6eae36ee5177a599c965973725f.

BUG: 247486
