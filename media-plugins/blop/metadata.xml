		BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA plugins that generate bandlimited
		sawtooth, square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves, for
		use in LADSPA hosts, principally for use with one of the many modular
		software synthesisers available. They are wavetable based, and are
		designed to produce output with harmonic content as high as possible
		over a wide pitch range. Additionally, there are a few extra plugins to
		assist in building synthesis networks.
