		This project is a powerful tool for penetration testing, exploit
		development, and vulnerability research.  The Framework is written in
		the Perl scripting language and includes various components written in
		C, assembler, and Python.  This project can be roughly compared to
		commercial offerings such as Immunity's CANVAS and Core Security
		Technology's Impact.  The major difference between the Framework and
		these commercial products is the focus; while the commercial products
		need to always provide the latest exploits and an intuitive GUI, the
		Framework was designed to facilitate research and experimentation with
		new technologies.
