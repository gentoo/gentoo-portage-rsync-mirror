		Kaa-base provides the base Kaa framework and is an implicit
		dependency for all kaa modules. The kaa framework includes a
		mainloop facility with an API for signals and callbacks, timers,
		process and thread management, file descriptor monitoring (with
		INotify support), inter-process communication, as well as a
		rich, practically magical API for asynchronous programming.
