  Backend compiler for high-level typed code with first-class support
  for multi-dimensional arrays, list tuples and dicts. High-level
  operations are optimized and must be lowered to a runtime
  implementation. Provided runtime implementations are in place for
  memory management and garbage collection, exceptions and threads.
