    The Enthought Tool Suite BlockCanvas project provides a visual
    environment for creating simulation experiments, where function
    and data are separated. Thus, you can define your simulation
    algorithm by visually connecting function blocks into a data flow
    network, and then run it with various data sets (known as
    "contexts"); likewise, you can use the same context in a different
    functional simulation.
