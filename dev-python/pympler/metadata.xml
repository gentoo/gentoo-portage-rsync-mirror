Pympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the memory 
behavior of Python objects in a running Python application. By pympling a 
Python application, detailed insight in the size and the lifetime of Python 
objects can be obtained. Undesirable or unexpected runtime behavior like 
memory bloat and other "pymples" can easily be identified.
