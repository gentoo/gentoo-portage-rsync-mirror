    Fixtures defines a Python contract for reusable state / support logic,
	primarily for unit testing. Helper and adaption logic is included to make
	it easy to write your own fixtures using the fixtures contract. Glue code
	is provided that makes using fixtures that meet the Fixtures contract in
	unittest compatible test cases easy and straight forward.
