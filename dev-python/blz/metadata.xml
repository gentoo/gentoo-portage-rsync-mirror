  BLZ is a chunked container for numerical data. Chunking allows for
  efficient enlarging/shrinking of data container. In addition, it can
  also be compressed for reducing memory/disk needs. The compression
  process is carried out internally by Blosc, a high-performance
  compressor that is optimized for binary data.
