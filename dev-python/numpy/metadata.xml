  <longdescription lang="en">
  NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing Python package designed to
  efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
  records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
  arrays. There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform,
  basic linear algebra and random number generation.
  It is the successor of Numeric and numarray.
