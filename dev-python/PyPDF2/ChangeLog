*PyPDF2-1.24 (03 Jan 2015)

  03 Jan 2015; Ian Delaney <idella4@gentoo.org> +PyPDF2-1.24.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  ebuild written by me, Jan 3. Required in the bump of xhtml2pdf-0.0.6 to
  substitute dev-python/pyPdf, of which PyPDF2 is a fork.  The original name
  using camel case is retained since it poses no problem once installed.
  Conversion to lowercase causes far more pain than it cures.
