    If you have \cite commands in \section-like commands, or in \caption, the
	citation will also appear in the table of contents, or list of whatever. If
	you are also using an unsrt-like bibliography style, these citations will
	come at the very start of the bibliography, which is confusing. This package
	suppresses the effect.
