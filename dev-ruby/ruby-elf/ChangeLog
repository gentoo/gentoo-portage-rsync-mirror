  19 Oct 2014; Diego E. Pettenò <flameeyes@gentoo.org> ruby-elf-1.0.8.ebuild,
  ruby-elf-9999.ebuild:
  Make both live and release to work with ruby20 and not jruby.

  11 Oct 2014; Hans de Graaff <graaff@gentoo.org> ruby-elf-9999.ebuild:
  Remove jruby now that it is no longer in the tree. It now triggers a repoman
  warning.

  24 Apr 2014; Manuel Rüger <mrueg@gentoo.org> ruby-elf-1.0.8.ebuild,
  ruby-elf-9999.ebuild:
  Remove ruby18 support.

  23 Jun 2013; Hans de Graaff <graaff@gentoo.org> ruby-elf-1.0.8.ebuild:
  Actually test the new code, rather than what is already installed.

*ruby-elf-9999 (20 Feb 2013)
*ruby-elf-1.0.8 (20 Feb 2013)

  20 Feb 2013; Diego E. Pettenò <flameeyes@gentoo.org> +ruby-elf-1.0.8.ebuild,
  +ruby-elf-9999.ebuild, -ruby-elf-1.0.6.1.ebuild, -ruby-elf-1.0.7.ebuild:
  Version bump and add live ebuild. These new ebuilds always require the tools
  to generate the man pages, as they are no longer shipped with the tarball, and
  installs as a full gem.
