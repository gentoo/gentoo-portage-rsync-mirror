		Thor is a simple and efficient tool for building self-documenting
		command line utilities. It removes the pain of parsing command line
		options, writing "USAGE:" banners, and can also be used as an
		alternative to the Rake build tool. The syntax is Rake-like, so it
		should be familiar to most Rake users.
