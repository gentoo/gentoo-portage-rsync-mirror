PolyORB aims at providing a uniform solution to build distributed applications;
relying either on industrial-strength middleware standards such as CORBA,
the Distributed System Annex of Ada 95, distribution programming paradigms such as
Web Services, Message Oriented Middleware (MOM), or to implement application-specific
middleware.
