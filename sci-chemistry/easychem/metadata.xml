    EasyChem is a program designed to draw chemical molecules, written under
	Linux using Gtk+ 2.4. It is implemented with a strong focus on producing
	press quality molecules. Easychem can be a little more difficult to learn to
	use, but when mastered it can be very fast and powerful. It can draw
	ornaments easily, and exports to EPS with LaTeX fonts among other things.
