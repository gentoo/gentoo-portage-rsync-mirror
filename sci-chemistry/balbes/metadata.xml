	BALBES is a system for solving protein structures using x-ray 
	crystalographic data. Molecular Replacement(MR) is its core 
	scientific method. BALBES aims to integrate all components, 
	necessary for finding a solution structure by MR, into one system. 
	It consists of a database, scientific programs and a python 
	pipeline. The system is automated so that it needs no user's 
	intervention when running complicated combination of jobs such 
	as model searching, molecular replacement and refinement.
