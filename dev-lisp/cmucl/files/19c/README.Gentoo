* README.Gentoo -- Gentoo Specific Notes for dev-lisp/cmucl

** About dev-lisp/cmucl 

The dev-lisp/cmucl ebuild in portage aim to provide a port of
Debian's package of CMUCL.  Thus the Gentoo CMUCL port should be
binary compatible with the Debian port.

** Linux Miscellaneous Binary Support

You can have your compiled Lisp .x86f files automatically executed
like any other binary by executing the following command:

  echo ':lisp:E::x86f::/usr/bin/lisp-start:' \
    >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register

Note: you need kernel support for this.  A good place to put the
above command is in your /etc/conf.d/localstart.

** Credit

This Gentoo package, like many other Gentoo packages in the dev-lisp
category, benifit from the Debian Project's work.
