CLX is an X11 client library for Common Lisp. The code was originally
taken from a CMUCL distribution, was modified somewhat in order to
make it compile and run under SBCL and other implementation, then a
selection of patches were added from other CLXes around the net.  Main
features:

 - SHAPE extension
 - XFREE86-VIDMODE extension
 - experimental RENDER extension
 - X Authority support that works with SSH forwarding

CLX is to Common Lisp, what xlib is to C.
